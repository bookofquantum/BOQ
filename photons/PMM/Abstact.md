Abstract:
We propose and computationally explore the concept of a Photonic Majorana Material (PMM), a synthetic medium designed to emulate the behavior of Majorana fermions within a photonic lattice framework. Leveraging the topological properties of engineered photonic band structures, we demonstrate the emergence of Majorana-like zero-energy modes in one-dimensional Kitaev and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, and outline a path towards realizing these modes in two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. By simulating the energy spectra and analyzing the localization of edge states, we establish the feasibility of creating robust topological photonic systems. This research paves the way for novel applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing, topological photonic circuits, and the simulation of exotic quantum phenomena, harnessing the unique properties of Majorana-like excitations in a controllable photonic environment.
