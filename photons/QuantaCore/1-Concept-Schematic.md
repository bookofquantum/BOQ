### **Further Refinements and Next Steps:**

- **Graphical Detailing:**  
  While the ASCII diagram provides an excellent high-level view, transitioning to detailed CAD schematics would allow you to define component dimensions, material stacks, and interconnect layouts with greater precision.

- **Transistor-Level Design:**  
  Detailed circuit diagrams for the control and classical units (down to transistor-level schematics) would be necessary for verifying the performance and integration of CMOS components.

- **Waveguide and Thermal Simulation:**  
  Incorporating simulation results—using tools like Lumerical for photonic simulations and COMSOL for thermal analysis—will help validate the design’s performance and identify areas for optimization.

- **Fabrication Process:**  
  A clear process flow detailing CMOS-compatible fabrication, including lithography steps, etching, and deposition techniques, would solidify the design’s feasibility under present-day technology.

- **Error Correction and Signal Integrity:**  
  Further development of the quantum error correction circuitry, including detailed timing diagrams and error budget analysis, will be key to ensuring that the system maintains high fidelity despite the complexity of 1.3M+ Qubitrons.
