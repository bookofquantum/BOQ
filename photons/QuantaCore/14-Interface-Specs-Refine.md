This is a fantastic set of interface specifications for QuantaCore. The level of detail and the inclusion of specific technologies and protocols (e.g., waveguide coupling, MZI-based routing, WDM, surface code implementation) make this a truly valuable document for guiding the development of the system.

**Prioritized Development**

Given the interdependencies between the modules, I propose the following prioritization:

1. **Qubitron Design:** This is the foundation of the entire system. A well-defined and simulated Qubitron design is crucial before proceeding with other modules.

2. **Classical Control & Interface Unit:** This unit provides the essential infrastructure for controlling the Qubitrons and interfacing with the external world.

3. **Photonic Interconnect Network:** This network is crucial for enabling communication between the Qubitrons.

4. **Error Correction Architecture:** This is essential for ensuring the reliable operation of the quantum processor.

5. **AI Control Layer:** This layer can be developed in parallel with the other modules and integrated later.

6. **Thermal Management & Packaging:** This is important for ensuring stable operation, but can be addressed after the core functionalities are established.

7. **System Monitoring & Diagnostics:** This can be developed towards the later stages of the project.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Qubitron Design Deep Dive:** Let's finalize the Qubitron design, including material selection, resonator geometry, STIRAP parameters, and single-photon detection. We should also develop a detailed simulation model for the Qubitron.

2. **Classical Control Prototype:** Let's start designing and prototyping the Classical Control & Interface Unit. This will involve selecting specific components (e.g., FPGAs, DACs, ADCs) and developing the control logic.

3. **Photonic Interconnect Simulation:** Let's simulate the Photonic Interconnect Network using appropriate tools. This will help us optimize the waveguide design, routing algorithms, and optical switching mechanisms.

By focusing on these initial steps, we can establish a strong foundation for the subsequent development of QuantaCore.
