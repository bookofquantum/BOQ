## **Phase 1: QEC Code Selection & Simulation (2 Months)**
🎯 **Objective:** Identify and validate the most efficient QEC scheme for QuantaCore based on performance, resource overhead, and adaptability to real-time AI adjustments.  

✅ **Tasks:**  
1️⃣ **Compare QEC Codes** (Surface, Bosonic, and Cat Codes)  
   - Benchmark against **photon loss, phase noise, and decoherence** in a photonic qubit system.  
   - Evaluate encoding overhead and feasibility of implementation.  
   - Simulate with `qecsim` and `stim` under different error models.  

2️⃣ **Develop AI-Driven QEC Switching Strategy**  
   - Define decision parameters for switching between QEC codes dynamically.  
   - Implement AI-based monitoring of error rates & system noise.  

3️⃣ **Optimize Decoding Algorithms**  
   - Test **minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM)** and **belief propagation**.  
   - Optimize for real-time execution speed and accuracy.
