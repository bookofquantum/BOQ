- **Instruction Buffer:** Stores decoded instructions for execution.

### Clock & Timing Reference
Provides precise clock and timing signals for synchronization.
- **Atomic Clock:** Provides a highly stable and accurate time reference.
- **FPGA-based Clock Generator:** Generates clock signals with precise frequency and phase control.
- **Clock Distribution Network:** Distributes clock signals to various modules with low skew and jitter.

### Command Decoder & Processor
Decodes incoming commands and generates control signals for Qubitrons.
- **Instruction Decoder:** Decodes instructions from the instruction buffer.
- **Control Signal Encoder:** Encodes control signals for Qubitrons.
- **Microcontroller/Processor:** Manages decoding, encoding, and other control tasks.

### Clock Generator & Distributor
Generates and distributes clock and timing signals to the Qubitron array for synchronization.
- **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL):** Generates precise clock signals with low jitter.
- **Clock Divider/Multiplier:** Adjusts the clock frequency as needed.

- **Pulse Shaper:** Shapes analog waveforms to create the desired pulse profiles (e.g., hyperbolic secant pulses).
- **Amplifier:** Amplifies pulses to the required power level.

### Measurement Data Processor
Processes measurement data received from the Qubitrons.
- **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):** Converts analog measurement signals to digital data.
- **Signal Processing Unit:** Performs filtering, averaging, and data extraction.
- **Data Buffer:** Stores processed measurement data.

### Error Correction Module
Implements error correction algorithms based on measurement data.
- **Error Detection Unit:** Detects errors using syndrome measurements or other techniques.
- **Decoder:** Decodes error information and identifies correction operations.
- **Correction Unit:** Applies correction operations to Qubitrons.

### AI Control Layer
Provides adaptive control and optimization based on feedback from the Qubitrons and the error correction module.
- **AI Model:** Implements AI-driven adaptive control and optimization.
- **Data Interface:** Exchanges data with the measurement processor and error correction module.
- **Control Interface:** Sends control signals to the control signal generator and error correction module.
