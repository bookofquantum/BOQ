**Key Changes and Considerations for Present-Day Technology:**

* **Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) Waveguides:**  SOI is a mature and widely used platform for photonic integrated circuits. It offers good optical confinement, low loss, and is compatible with CMOS fabrication processes. This makes it a suitable choice for the photonic interconnect network in QuantaCore.
* **Advanced Thermal Management:** While cryogenic cooling is still a possibility for future versions, present-day technology relies on advanced thermal management techniques to maintain the operating temperature of the chip. This includes efficient heat sinks, microfluidic cooling, and careful thermal design of the chip layout.
* **Qubitron Design:** The Qubitrons would need to be designed using currently available materials and fabrication techniques. This may involve trade-offs in terms of performance, size, and complexity.
* **Control Electronics:** The control electronics for the Qubitrons and the photonic network would need to be implemented using current CMOS technology. This may limit the speed and precision of control.
* **Integration Challenges:** Integrating all the components (photonic, electronic, and thermal) onto a single chip while maintaining high performance and reliability is a significant challenge.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Optical Amplification:**  Due to potential losses in the SOI waveguides and other optical components, on-chip optical amplifiers might be necessary to maintain signal strength across the large photonic network.
* **Packaging:** Advanced packaging techniques are crucial to manage thermal dissipation, provide electrical and optical interconnections, and protect the chip from the environment.
* **Error Correction:** Implementing efficient error correction schemes with current technology is challenging. Hybrid approaches combining classical and quantum error correction techniques might be necessary.

**Overall, this revised schematic reflects the constraints of present-day technology while still aiming for the ambitious goal of a million-qubit quantum microprocessor. It highlights the importance of material selection, thermal management, and integration challenges in realizing QuantaCore with current capabilities.**

It's important to note that this is still a conceptual design. The actual implementation would require detailed engineering and optimization to achieve the desired performance and scalability.
