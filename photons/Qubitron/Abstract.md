Qubitron is a photonic qubit that provides superposition by adding a photon detector to the design of a photonic transistor. Using avalanche diodes as the detector, the device can operate at room temperature. The connections provide classical base, classical emitter, classical collector, mode (classical, virtual, quantum), virtual superposition, quantum superposition, and quantum bit. This device enables hybrid photonic quantum computing. The classical mode operates exactly like a transistor. The virtual mode is a virtual qubit provides superposition by counting photons in the device. Quantum mode uses the actual photon. This device uses present day materials and fabrication techniques.
