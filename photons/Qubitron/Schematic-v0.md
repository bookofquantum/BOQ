      Mode Selection:
          - Classical:  Control Logic directs signal flow through transistor core, ignoring detector and quantum outputs.  Operates as standard transistor.
          - Virtual:   Control Logic enables detector and Signal Processing unit. Photon counts are used to represent superposition. Quantum outputs are inactive.
          - Quantum: Control Logic directs signal to Quantum and Qubit Outputs.  Photon state is used for superposition.

      Connections:
          - Classical Base:  Electrical input to control transistor operation (Classical Mode).
          - Classical Emitter: Electrical output from the transistor core (Classical Mode).
          - Classical Collector: Electrical output from the detector (Classical Mode).
          - Mode:  Digital input to select operation mode (Classical, Virtual, Quantum).
          - Virtual Superposition:  Digital output representing photon count (Virtual Mode).
          - Quantum Superposition:  Optical output representing the photon state (Quantum Mode).
          - Quantum Bit:  Encoded quantum bit output (e.g., polarization, time-bin) (Quantum Mode).

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Signal Flow:** The diagram now shows a more logical flow of photons and signals.
* **Component Breakdown:** Key components like the photonic transistor core (which could be a micro-ring resonator or Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI)), beam splitters, photon detector (avalanche diode), and control logic are explicitly labeled.
* **Mode Selection:** The control logic's role in selecting the operational mode (Classical, Virtual, Quantum) is highlighted.
* **Output Distinction:** The different outputs (Classical Emitter/Collector, Virtual Superposition, Quantum Superposition, Qubit) are clearly separated and labeled.
* **Input/Output Labels:**  Photon input (λ), classical base input, and all outputs are labeled.
* **Virtual Superposition Clarification:** The Signal Processing unit and its connection to the Virtual Superposition output are added, clarifying how photon counts are used in virtual mode.
* **Quantum Output Emphasis:**  The Quantum Superposition and Qubit outputs are separated to emphasize that the *state* of the photon is used for superposition, while the encoded qubit might be represented by a specific property of that photon (e.g., polarization).

This improved schematic provides a more detailed and accurate representation of the Qubitron's architecture and operation.  While ASCII has limitations, this attempts to capture the essential elements and connections.  A proper graphical schematic would be even more effective.
