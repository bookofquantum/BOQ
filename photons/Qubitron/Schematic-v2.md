      Mode Selection (Control Logic - Microcontroller/FPGA with Quantum Error Mitigation):
          - Classical:  Routes signals through transistor core (not shown).
          - Virtual:   Activates STIRAP module, Virtual Mode, and selects output.
          - Quantum:  Routes signals to Quantum/Qubit outputs (not shown).

      Connections (Key Signal Types):
          - Input Interface:  Optical/Microwave coherent pulses, electrical control signals.
          - Traditional Photon Readout:  Electrical signals (photon counts, voltages, processed data).
          - Virtual Superposition Output:  Optical (polarization, phase, frequency), or other physical qubit encoding.

      Additional Details/Considerations:

          - Virtual Mode Implementation:  Specific physical implementation details (micro-ring resonator parameters, transmon design, cavity parameters) are crucial.
          - STIRAP Pulse Parameters:  Pulse shapes (Gaussian, Sinusoidal), durations, relative phases are precisely controlled.
          - Noise and Decoherence:  Minimizing noise (thermal, electrical) and decoherence in the virtual mode is essential.  Cryogenic cooling might be needed for some implementations.
          - Calibration and Control:  Precise calibration and control of all components (lasers, modulators, detectors) are necessary.
          - Integration:  Integration with other quantum components (other qubits, quantum gates, QubitX) for complex quantum information processing.
          - Material Selection: SOI, Lithium Niobate, III-V semiconductors, other materials depending on implementation.
          - Fabrication: Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC) fabrication techniques.

This is the most detailed ASCII representation I can create within the character limits.  It includes all the key refinements and enhancements we discussed, along with more specific examples of the technologies and techniques involved.  It also emphasizes crucial practical considerations like noise, calibration, and integration.

While this is much more detailed, a true schematic would be a graphical representation with precisely defined components, connections, and layout.  This ASCII version serves as a comprehensive textual description of the Qubitron's architecture and operation.
