Legend:

* Mode Selection:  Selects the operational mode of the device.
* Classical Control:  Operates the photonic transistor in classical mode.
* Avalanche Diode:  Detects photons for virtual and quantum modes.
* Virtual Control:  Counts detected photons for virtual qubit representation.
* Quantum Control:  Manipulates the quantum state of photons for quantum computation.
* Virtual Input/Output:  Photon stream and count data for virtual mode.
* Quantum Input/Output: Single photon and qubit state for quantum mode.

Key Improvements:

* **Mode Selection:** Explicitly added a mode selection block to manage the different operational modes.
* **Photon Source:** Made the photon source optional, allowing for external or integrated sources.
* **Input/Output Clarity:**  Clearly labeled the inputs and outputs for each mode, including the type of data (photon stream, count data, qubit state).
* **Control Separation:** Separated the control logic for each mode, emphasizing their distinct functions.
* **Simplified Structure:** Streamlined the diagram to focus on the key components and their interactions.

This revised schematic provides a better high-level overview of Qubitron, highlighting the flow of information and control signals in each mode.  It's still a simplification, but it's more informative and easier to understand.  Detailed layout and material specifications would require a more specialized format like GDSII.
