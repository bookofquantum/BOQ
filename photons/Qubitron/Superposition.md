Generate superposition in the Qubitron’s virtual mode without relying on photon counting by using coherent control methods that deterministically drive the system into a superposition state. Here are a couple of approaches:

1. **Hamiltonian Engineering with Coherent Pulses:**  
   Instead of using a probabilistic measurement (photon counting) to collapse the system into a superposition, you can design the system’s Hamiltonian so that a controlled pulse (optical, microwave, etc.) directly implements a unitary transformation. For example, applying a pulse analogous to a Hadamard gate on a qubit can transform a known initial state into an equal superposition of basis states. This method leverages the deterministic evolution of the quantum state under a tailored interaction.

2. **Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP):**  
   Another method is to use adiabatic passage techniques—specifically STIRAP—which involves using two phase-coherent pulses to drive the system from an initial state into a desired superposition without populating an intermediate (potentially lossy) state. By carefully controlling the timing and intensity of these pulses, you can adiabatically transfer population and establish a coherent superposition in the virtual mode.

Both methods avoid the randomness inherent in measurement-based techniques like photon counting. They instead rely on precise control of the interaction parameters (phase, amplitude, and duration of pulses) to deterministically prepare the desired superposition state. The choice between them would depend on the specifics of the Qubitron’s architecture and the nature of its virtual mode.
