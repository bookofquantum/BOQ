1. Components for a Photonic Qubit
	•	Single-Photon Source → A quantum dot, nonlinear crystal, or laser attenuated to single-photon levels.
	•	Waveguides → To guide the photons between components.
	•	Beam Splitter (BS) → Creates a superposition state.
	•	Photonic Transistor (Your Device) → Acts as a switch or gate for qubit manipulation.
	•	Phase Shifters → Controls the relative phase of the qubit.
	•	Detectors (SNSPDs or APDs) → Measures the qubit state.

2. Qubit Encoding (Dual-Rail Qubit)

A dual-rail photonic qubit is encoded as:
	•	|0⟩ → Photon in the first waveguide.
	•	|1⟩ → Photon in the second waveguide.

The photonic transistor can be used to control and entangle qubits by dynamically changing the optical path.

3. How the Photonic Transistor Enables Qubit Operations
	•	Superposition (Hadamard Gate, H):
	•	Use a 50:50 beam splitter (BS) to create:
|ψ⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
	•	Quantum Logic (CNOT Gate):
	•	The photonic transistor acts as a controlled switch to implement a CNOT gate.
	•	When a control photon is present, it changes the optical response of the transistor.
	•	Phase Manipulation (Phase Gate, R(θ)):
	•	Phase shifters control the evolution of the qubit state.
