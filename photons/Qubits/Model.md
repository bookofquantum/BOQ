### Notes:
- **Alignment**: Precise alignment is crucial for the efficiency and accuracy of the experiment. Use kinematic mounts for fine adjustments.
- **Control**: The control electronics would interface with the phase shifter and polarization controllers to manipulate the quantum state of the photons.
- **Data Collection**: The data acquisition system would handle the output from the detectors to perform quantum state tomography or other analyses.
- **Safety**: Ensure proper eye protection when working with lasers and consider the cryogenic requirements for SNSPDs if used.

This setup provides a basic framework for experimenting with photonic qubits, where you can manipulate polarization or phase to create and study quantum states. Remember, real-world experimentation might require additional components for stability, noise reduction, or advanced quantum operations.
