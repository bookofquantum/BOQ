## 4. Implementation Details
The implementation involves setting up the laser sources, waveguides, and optical modulators in a controlled environment. The photon detector is calibrated to accurately detect the superposition states at the output. Various configurations and parameters are tested to optimize the performance of the photonic transistor.

## 5. Creating a Photonic Qubit
To create a photonic qubit, the following steps are carried out:

### 5.1 Qubit Initialization
Utilize the control photon beam to initialize the quantum state of the data photon beam. This is typically done using specific laser pulses that prepare the photon in a superposition state, represented as |\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle.

### 5.2 Quantum Gate Operations
Employ the optical modulator to perform quantum gate operations on the photon. Quantum gates like the Hadamard gate, CNOT gate, and phase shift gate can be implemented using the interaction of photons in the nonlinear material and the modulation of their paths.

### 5.3 Superposition and Entanglement
Use the optical cavity and nonlinear material to create and maintain superposition and entanglement states. The nonlinear interaction allows for the creation of entangled states between multiple photons, essential for quantum computing.

### 5.4 Photon Detection and Measurement
After performing the required quantum operations, the photon detector at the output will measure the quantum state of the photon. The detection process collapses the qubit state, allowing for the readout of the quantum information encoded on the photon.
