Abstract:

We propose the Zero-Point Photonic Condenser (ZPPC)—a quantum photonic device capable of extracting usable quantum information and energy from vacuum fluctuations at room temperature. Operating through engineered photonic crystal lattices embedded with non-Hermitian topological defects, the ZPPC leverages quantum interference and vacuum-induced coherence to condense zero-point photons into measurable, entangled photonic states without external input energy. This condensation process forms a persistent, low-entropy quantum reservoir, which can initialize logic qubits, amplify entanglement, and regenerate decohered photonic qubits via non-demolition readout.

At the core of ZPPC lies a chiral-looped photonic bandgap structure with embedded synthetic axionic couplers, enabling directional control of Casimir-like photon generation. An integrated Majorana photonic isolator ensures unidirectional quantum information flow and stabilizes entanglement channels across integrated quantum networks.

Unlike conventional photon sources or qubit initializers, the ZPPC does not rely on laser pumping, cryogenics, or external electromagnetic inputs. Instead, it continuously harvests quantum noise, converting it into structured qubit seeds via geometric-phase locking in a topologically protected photonic shell. This positions the ZPPC as a self-sustaining, passive quantum initializer, ideal for scalable room-temperature quantum computing, ambient quantum sensing, and quantum-enhanced neural interfaces.
