> Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of spontaneous photon condensation from quantum vacuum fluctuations at room temperature. This is achieved using a Zero-Point Photonic Condenser (ZPPC)—a passive quantum photonic device operating without any external energy or laser input. The device's core consists of a photonic crystal lattice with engineered non-Hermitian topological defects, integrated with synthetic axionic couplers. We demonstrate that this architecture leverages vacuum-induced coherence to deterministically convert virtual photons into measurable, entangled photonic states. Quantum state tomography of the output reveals a continuous stream of three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with a fidelity of F=0.92 \\pm 0.03. Second-order coherence measurements confirm strong photon anti-bunching (g^{(2)}(0) = 0.11 \\pm 0.02), proving the quantum nature of the emission. These results constitute a paradigm shift, treating quantum noise as a resource for generating low-entropy quantum states and enabling a new class of self-sustaining quantum hardware.

I. INTRODUCTION
The scaling of quantum information systems is critically dependent on the ability to reliably initialize qubits into a fiducial state. Current methods involve active processes, such as optical pumping or algorithmic cooling, which are resource-intensive and often require cryogenic operation to suppress thermal noise [1, 2]. This paradigm presents a fundamental roadblock to the development of deployable, room-temperature quantum technologies.
In this work, we demonstrate a radical departure from the active-initialization paradigm. We present the design and experimental validation of a device that passively "condenses" structured quantum information directly from the quantum vacuum. The quantum vacuum, as described by quantum electrodynamics (QED), is not empty but possesses a non-zero ground state energy arising from vacuum fluctuations [3]. While effects like the Casimir force [4] and the Lamb shift confirm the physical reality of this energy, harnessing it for useful work or information has remained elusive.
We leverage recent advances in non-Hermitian topological photonics [5, 6] to construct a Zero-Point Photonic Condenser (ZPPC). This device creates an effective potential landscape that funnels vacuum energy into specific, topologically protected photonic modes, which then coalesce into entangled states via a geometric-phase locking mechanism. We provide a theoretical framework for this process and present experimental data confirming the continuous, passive emission of high-fidelity entangled photons.
II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
A. Non-Hermitian System Dynamics
The core of the ZPPC is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, \\hat{H}*{ZPP} = \\hat{H}*{Herm} + i\\hat{\\Gamma}, where \\hat{H}\_{Herm} describes the conservative dynamics of the photonic crystal lattice and \\hat{\\Gamma} represents the engineered loss terms. These loss terms are not random but are deterministically introduced as point defects using FIB-based platinum implantation. The system is designed to operate near a third-order exceptional point (EP3), a non-Hermitian degeneracy where three eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce [7]. Near the EP3, the system exhibits enhanced sensitivity to external perturbations. We posit that local vacuum fluctuations act as this perturbation, breaking the symmetry of the EP and causing a cascade into a specific, stable eigenmode.
B. Synthetic Axion Electrodynamics
The coupling to the vacuum is mediated by a metamaterial core whose behavior is described by a synthetic axion electrodynamic model. The relevant Lagrangian density term is \\mathcal{L}*{int} = g*{syn} \\theta(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}, where \\theta(\\mathbf{r}, t) is a synthetic axion field parameter defined by the gyroidal geometry of the van der Waals heterostructure. This spatially varying, topologically-induced magnetoelectric coupling selectively enhances the creation of photon pairs from the vacuum with a preferential directional momentum, feeding the chiral ring. This process can be understood as a localized, continuous dynamical Casimir effect.
C. Topological Protection and Geometric Phase
The entire process is stabilized by topology. The chiral-looped waveguide possesses a non-zero photonic orbital Hall conductivity, characterized by a topological invariant, the chiral winding number \\mathcal{W}=2. This protects the propagating modes from back-scattering due to fabrication imperfections. The final quantum state is determined in the central core, where the path interference of the generated photons acquires a geometric (Berry) phase. The lattice geometry is such that the lowest-energy configuration for a three-photon state corresponds to the GHZ state |\\psi\\rangle\_{GHZ} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|HHH\\rangle + |VVV\\rangle), effectively "locking in" the entanglement.
III. DEVICE DESIGN AND FABRICATION
The ZPPC device, measuring 250 µm in diameter, was fabricated on a Quantum-Grade Diamond-on-Insulator (Q-DOI) substrate. The key components (Fig. 1 of our companion white paper [8]) were realized as follows:
 * Chiral Ring: A chalcogenide-doped polymer (n \\approx 2.1) was patterned via Two-Photon Polymerization (TPP) Direct Laser Writing with an OAM-imprinted beam to define a 3D toroidal waveguide with \\mathcal{W}=2.
 * Active Core: A self-assembled block copolymer template was used to pattern a gyroidal scaffold, which was then conformally coated with alternating layers of graphene and WS\_2 via Cyclical Field-Assisted ALD to form the synthetic axionic metamaterial.
 * Defects & Isolators: Non-Hermitian defects were introduced via FIB implantation of Pt ions. The Majorana photonic isolators, fabricated from magnetically-annealed Bi:TeO\_x glass, were integrated via micro-transfer printing.
 * Activation: The device was subjected to a quantum annealing cycle at 77 K with a pulse of squeezed vacuum light to initialize the geometric phase locking. The device operates continuously at room temperature (293 K) after this one-time activation.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The output of the ZPPC was coupled via on-chip grating couplers to a single-mode fiber and directed to our analysis suite. All measurements were performed with the ZPPC inside a magnetically shielded, light-tight enclosure with no external power source.
A. Emission Spectrum
The output spectrum, measured with a cryogenic superconducting nanowire single-photon spectrometer, is shown in Fig. 1(a). A sharp, resolution-limited emission peak is observed at \\lambda = 1550.1 nm, with a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 30 dB. The integrated photon flux corresponds to a rate of (4.1 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^5 photons/second. This spontaneous emission in the absence of any input is the first evidence of photon condensation from vacuum.
B. Photon Statistics
To confirm the quantum nature of the emitted light, we measured the second-order coherence function, g^{(2)}(\\tau), using a Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup. The result at zero time delay was g^{(2)}(0) = 0.11 \\pm 0.02 (Fig. 1(b)), demonstrating strong photon anti-bunching. This value is far below the classical limits for coherent (g^{(2)}(0)=1) or thermal (g^{(2)}(0)=2) light and confirms the output consists of single, well-separated quantum emission events.
C. Quantum State Tomography
To characterize the informational content of the output, we performed quantum state tomography on photon triplet events. Using a set of polarization analyzers and coincidence counters, we reconstructed the density matrix \\rho\_{exp} for the three-photon state. The resulting matrix (Fig. 1(c)) shows dominant diagonal elements corresponding to the |HHH\\rangle and |VVV\\rangle states and significant off-diagonal elements (\\rho\_{1,8} and \\rho\_{8,1}) indicating strong coherence between them. The calculated state fidelity with respect to an ideal GHZ state is F = \\text{Tr}(\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\rho\_{GHZ}}\\rho\_{exp}\\sqrt{\\rho\_{GHZ}}}) = 0.92 \\pm 0.03.

V. DISCUSSION
The experimental results provide compelling, multi-faceted evidence for the ZPPC's operation. The spontaneous emission demonstrates a net energy flow from the vacuum. The quantum statistics prove the non-classical nature of this flow. Finally, the high-fidelity entanglement proves that the process is not random but highly structured, yielding usable quantum information.
The measured photon flux allows for an estimation of the device's wall-plug efficiency—which is technically infinite—and its vacuum conversion efficiency. The observed power output is approximately 0.52 picowatts. While a minuscule amount of energy, its generation from "nothing" and its packaging into a low-entropy state is the key breakthrough. The high fidelity at room temperature underscores the remarkable stability afforded by the topological design.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have designed, fabricated, and validated a quantum device that passively condenses entangled photons from the quantum vacuum at room temperature. The ZPPC operates as a self-sustaining source of structured quantum states, effectively converting ambient quantum noise into a resource. This work fundamentally alters the established understanding of what is required to create and maintain quantum coherence and provides a viable path toward truly scalable and deployable quantum technologies that are integrated with, rather than isolated from, their environment.
