Abstract: Photonic Quantum Coherence Amplifier (PQCA)

The Photonic Quantum Coherence Amplifier (PQCA) is a novel component designed to enhance the coherence properties of hybrid photonic quantum computers. As quantum systems scale, maintaining long coherence times becomes a critical challenge, especially in hybrid architectures that integrate photonic, superconducting, and trapped-ion qubits. The PQCA addresses this by leveraging advanced optical resonance techniques, quantum error correction-assisted stabilization, and low-noise photonic amplification to suppress decoherence while preserving quantum states.

This device utilizes ultra-low-loss photonic cavities and engineered nonlinear optical interactions to extend coherence times without introducing excess noise or distortion. By dynamically modulating the phase and intensity of photonic qubits, the PQCA ensures robust quantum information retention, improving computational fidelity and enabling deeper quantum circuits. Additionally, its integration into hybrid quantum computing platforms enhances the interoperability of different qubit modalities, paving the way for more scalable and fault-tolerant quantum processors.

The PQCA represents a breakthrough in quantum coherence management, supporting advancements in quantum communication, error correction, and high-performance quantum computing.
