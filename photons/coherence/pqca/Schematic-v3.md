General Improvements:
 * Consistent Symbol Usage:  Use more consistent symbols for optical elements.  For example, instead of just M1, use something like |>M1 for a mirror, >-- for a waveguide, and O> for output. This will make the diagrams easier to parse.
 * Signal Flow:  Use arrows consistently to indicate the direction of light propagation.  This is crucial for understanding the flow of information and energy.
 * Clarity on Connections:  Make the connections between blocks more explicit. Instead of just a line, use symbols to indicate how the light is coupled between components.
 * Annotations: Add more annotations to explain the function of less common elements (e.g., PPLN, FPGA).
Specific Block Improvements:
 * High-Q Photonic Cavity:
   * More Detail on Mirrors:  Distinguish between the input/output coupling mirror (M2) and the high-reflectivity mirror (M1).  You could use different symbols or annotations (e.g., |>M1 (R~100%), |>M2 (R~99%)).
   * Waveguide Representation: Use a more waveguide-like symbol, perhaps something like =--=.
   * Phase Shifter Detail:  Indicate that the phase shifter is controlled by an external signal.  Perhaps add an input line labeled "Control Signal" going into the phase shifter.
 * Nonlinear Optical Medium:
   * Pump Laser:  Show the pump laser input more clearly.  Perhaps use a different symbol for the laser source and indicate the direction of the pump beam.  Something like L>-- for the laser.
   * Filter Type: Specify the type of filter (e.g., "Bandpass Filter," "Polarization Filter").  This is important because different filters serve different purposes.
 * Active Feedback Control:
   * Feedback Loop:  Emphasize the feedback loop. Show the connection from the photon detector to the FPGA/AI unit and then to the phase modulator.  Use arrows to indicate the direction of the feedback signal.
   * Detector Type: Specify the type of photon detector (e.g., "Single Photon Detector," "Balanced Photodiode").
 * Quantum Error Correction (QEC) Module:
   * Encoding/Decoding:  While you mention encoding and correction, it would be helpful to visually separate the encoding stage, the error detection stage, and the correction stage.  This could be done with boxes or labels.
   * Ancilla Qubits:  For a more complete representation of QEC, you could indicate the use of ancilla qubits.  This is a key aspect of many QEC schemes.
