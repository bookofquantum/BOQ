Abstract

The Photonic Quantum Coherence Amplifier (PQCA) is a novel quantum-optical device designed to enhance coherence times in hybrid photonic quantum computers. By leveraging ultra-low-loss photonic cavities, engineered nonlinear optical interactions, and active stabilization techniques, the PQCA suppresses decoherence while preserving quantum states. This paper explores the theoretical framework, design principles, and practical implementation of the PQCA, demonstrating its role in improving quantum information retention, enabling deeper quantum circuits, and enhancing the scalability of hybrid quantum architectures.

1. Introduction

Quantum computing holds the promise of revolutionizing computation, but its progress is hindered by decoherence, which limits the reliability and scalability of quantum systems. Hybrid photonic quantum computers—integrating photonic, superconducting, and trapped-ion qubits—offer advantages in connectivity and speed but require advanced coherence management techniques. The Photonic Quantum Coherence Amplifier (PQCA) is a new component that extends the coherence of quantum states, mitigating decoherence effects in photonic and hybrid quantum architectures.

This paper presents the theoretical foundation of the PQCA, its design considerations, and its role in enhancing the stability of quantum states. We discuss experimental validation strategies and potential applications in quantum computing and communication.

2. Theoretical Framework

2.1 Quantum Decoherence in Hybrid Photonic Systems

Decoherence arises from environmental interactions that collapse quantum superpositions. In hybrid systems, coherence loss occurs due to:
	•	Photon loss from optical waveguides and cavities
	•	Phase noise from imperfect control mechanisms
	•	Thermal fluctuations affecting material properties
	•	Interfacing inefficiencies between different qubit modalities

The PQCA addresses these issues by utilizing coherent photon amplification, quantum error correction principles, and optical resonance techniques to extend quantum coherence.

2.2 Principles of Coherence Amplification

The PQCA operates on three fundamental principles:
	1.	Quantum-Limited Optical Amplification: Low-noise parametric amplification maintains coherence while preventing signal degradation.
	2.	Dynamical Decoupling of Noise Sources: Modulated optical fields counteract environmental decoherence effects.
	3.	Resonant Optical Feedback: High-Q optical cavities reinforce quantum states through constructive interference.

Mathematically, the coherence function of a quantum state ￼ can be modeled as:

￼

where:
	•	￼ is the initial coherence,
	•	￼ is the decoherence rate,
	•	￼ is the PQCA-induced coherence enhancement,
	•	￼ is an amplification factor determined by the optical cavity parameters.

3. Design and Implementation

3.1 PQCA Architecture

The PQCA consists of:
	•	High-Q Photonic Cavities: Minimize photon loss and stabilize quantum states.
	•	Nonlinear Optical Medium: Enables phase-sensitive amplification with minimal added noise.
	•	Active Feedback Control: Adaptive phase correction mechanisms optimize coherence retention.
	•	Integrated Quantum Error Correction (QEC) Protocols: Enhance quantum state fidelity through redundancy and error suppression.

3.2 Fabrication and Integration

The PQCA is designed using:
	•	Silicon photonics for low-loss waveguides
	•	III-V semiconductor nonlinear materials for quantum-limited amplification
